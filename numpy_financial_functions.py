    Compute the payment against loan principal plus interest.

    Given:
     * a present value, `pv` (e.g., an amount borrowed)
     * a future value, `fv` (e.g., 0)
     * an interest `rate` compounded once per period, of which
       there are
     * `nper` total
     * and (optional) specification of whether payment is made
       at the beginning (`when` = {'begin', 1}) or the end
       (`when` = {'end', 0}) of each period

    Return:
       the (fixed) periodic payment.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rate : array_like
        Rate of interest (per period)
    nper : array_like
        Number of compounding periods
    pv : array_like
        Present value
    fv : array_like,  optional
        Future value (default = 0)
    when : {{'begin', 1}, {'end', 0}}, {string, int}
        When payments are due ('begin' (1) or 'end' (0))

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Payment against loan plus interest.  If all input is scalar, returns a
        scalar float.  If any input is array_like, returns payment for each
        input element. If multiple inputs are array_like, they all must have
        the same shape.

    Notes
    -----
    The payment is computed by solving the equation::

     fv +
     pv*(1 + rate)**nper +
     pmt*(1 + rate*when)/rate*((1 + rate)**nper - 1) == 0

    or, when ``rate == 0``::

      fv + pv + pmt * nper == 0

    for ``pmt``.

    Note that computing a monthly mortgage payment is only
    one use for this function.  For example, pmt returns the
    periodic deposit one must make to achieve a specified
    future balance given an initial deposit, a fixed,
    periodically compounded interest rate, and the total
    number of periods.

    In order to pay-off (i.e., have a future-value of 0) the $200,000 obtained
    today, a monthly payment of $1,854.02 would be required.  Note that this
    example illustrates usage of `fv` having a default value of 0.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import numpy_financial as npf

    What is the future value after 10 years of saving $100 now, with
    an additional monthly savings of $100.  Assume the interest rate is
    5% (annually) compounded monthly?

    >>> npf.fv(0.05/12, 10*12, -100, -100)
    15692.928894335748

    By convention, the negative sign represents cash flow out (i.e. money not
    available today).  Thus, saving $100 a month at 5% annual interest leads
    to $15,692.93 available to spend in 10 years.

    If any input is array_like, returns an array of equal shape.  Let's
    compare different interest rates from the example above.
